Ojective
=========

In this folder ill be collecting a bunch of applications that we can test our detection with. For now I'm collecting known vulnerable ones, but we might want to look into collecting some for false-positives too later.


Each file has a notes.md file that outlines the performance on the tests for each prompt. Currently Im just writing unstructured text, possibly (later) we could come up with a way to automate this. For now, the most important thing for me is that we have a number of tests that we can check the program on while developing. (not only gpt but the other plugins too)
