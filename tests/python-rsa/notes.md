This challenge might be unfair as I know GPT is bad with numbers.

However, every single detection is wrong, and it fully missed the critical issue.

The problem with this code is that the numbers for RSA are waay to small to be useful at all.

GPT did not tell me this, however it showed 3 different other problems. Some of which are somewhat valid, as unvalidated input could indeed make the program crash, however, it ignored what really matters.
