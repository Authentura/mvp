### Static scanners!

Our scanners excel the most at logic, and abstract vulnerabilities. To augment this with more speed and accuracy in syntactic misuses and simple vulnerabilities we have integrated python-bandit to authengaurd.

Bandit is a well known python security tool that is very effective at catching simple development mistakes that can lead to vulnerabilities. At Authentura we have great respect for the developers of bandit and truly believe that this is an amazing tool that can make Authenguard even more powerful.

Further, we will not stop at python! We intend to integrate any security tool that we believe could make Authenguard more effective (provided the license allows for it).
